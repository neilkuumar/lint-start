# Lint Start

There are plenty of great bootstrap projects out there, however, sometimes you have started a project that started off as a quick hack and evolved into something more or have joined an existing project without linting/prettier setup.

The idea here is a one time command that you can run to setup linting and prettier on your current project.

For example:
```zsh
npx lint-start
```
